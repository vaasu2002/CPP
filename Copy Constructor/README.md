#### Copy Constrcutor using shared pointer

        cout<<"calling destructor..."<<endl;
    }
};


int main(){
    shared_ptr<Base> b1 = make_shared<Base>();
    cout<<b1<<endl; // heap address-> address of object
    cout<<&b1<<endl; // stack address-> address of pointer
    {
        // ‚ùå DOES NOT call copy constructor
        shared_ptr<Base> b2 = b1; // same address as b2 just another reference
        cout<<b2<<endl;
        // destructor won't be called as there is still one reference left
    }
    {
        shared_ptr<Base> b2 = make_shared<Base>(*b1);
        cout<<b1<<" "<<b2<<endl;
        // both are in different address of heap
        // b2 has one reference
        // b1 also has one reference
        // b2 destrcutor will be called after this scope
