-  C++ is a general-purpose, high-performance programming language
-  #include directive to include libraries or header files into our program.
```cpp
#include <iostream>
```
-  The entry point of a C++ program is the main function. Every C++ program must have a main function
-  C++ allows us to write both **low-level code**, like memory manipulation, as well as **high-level abstractions**, like creating classes and using the Standard Template Library (STL).
#include <iostream>

```cpp
int number = 42;
int* ptr_number = &number;

// High-level programming
vector<int> vec = {1, 2, 3};
for(const auto &i: vec){
  cout << i << '\n';
}
```
- C++ is an extension of the C programming language, with added features such as object-oriented programming, classes, and exception handling.
