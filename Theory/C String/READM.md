## C string
In C, a string is a sequence of characters stored as an array and terminated by a null character ('\0'). Unlike some languages, C doesn't have a built-in string type. Instead, strings are represented using char arrays.

## #include<string>
In C++, things are much more convenient and safer due to the introduction of the Standard Library std::string class.
